#LECTURE NOTES
#string-length(s) returns the number of characters
#string-repeat(s, n) repeats string s, n number of times

#We can create basic shapes with functions like circle, rectangle, triangle
#circle(30, "solid", "blue")
#rectangle(40, 20, "solid", "green") #length, width
#triangle(50, "outline", "red")


#There are operations on images:
#overlay(i1,i2) creates a new image that has the first image on top of the second
#above(i1,i2) composes the images by creating a new image with i1 on top of i2
#below(i1,i2) composes images with i1 below i2

i1 = circle(20, "solid", "red")
i2 = rectangle(40, 10, "solid", "yellow")
below(i1, i2)

#|Further, operations have types that they take in, and types that they produce. These are usually written down in the documentation as contracts, with ::, e.g.:
* :: (Number, Number) -> Number
   circle :: (Number, String, String) -> Image |#
