# There's also a outer filter-with:

#This gives you the first row of the sorted table, which is now the maximum value in that column.

#EXERCISE 5
#So, our current formula is:

# score = 100 - (dep_delay - arr_delay) -       (air_time / 30)

#This penalizes long flights more due to air_time / 30. Hence, for more fairness:


#So an alternative we can use instead is that we use a normalized delay ratio:

score = 100 - ((dep_delay - arr_delay) / air_time) * 60

#This scales the delay impact relative to flight duration, making short and long flights more comparable.


      
EXPLANATION, MAKE IT INTO NOTES !!:
No worries, Rajesh â€” let's slow it down and walk through the **alternative score formula** piece by piece. You're trying to understand this:

```text
score = 100 - ((dep_delay - arr_delay) / air_time) * 60
```

This looks confusing, but we'll break it into **four simple parts**:

---

### ðŸ§© 1. What is `dep_delay - arr_delay`?

This measures how much **worse the departure delay was** compared to the arrival delay.

- If a flight left 60 minutes late but arrived only 30 minutes late, then:
  - `dep_delay - arr_delay = 60 - 30 = 30`
  - That means the flight **recovered 30 minutes** during the trip.

---

### ðŸ§© 2. Why divide by `air_time`?

We want to **normalize** the delay difference by how long the flight was.

- A 30-minute recovery on a 1-hour flight is amazing.
- A 30-minute recovery on a 5-hour flight is less impressive.

So we divide by `air_time` to make the score **fair** across short and long flights.

---

### ðŸ§© 3. Why multiply by 60?

Because `air_time` is in minutes, dividing by it gives a **per-minute ratio**. Multiplying by 60 turns it into a **per-hour penalty**, which matches the scale of the original formula.

---

### ðŸ§© 4. What does the whole formula do?

```text
score = 100 - ((dep_delay - arr_delay) / air_time) * 60
```

- Starts with a perfect score of 100.
- Subtracts a penalty based on how inefficient the flight was.
- The penalty is **bigger** if the flight didn't recover much delay.
- The penalty is **smaller** if the flight recovered delay efficiently.

---

### âœ… Example

Let's say:
- dep_delay = 60
- arr_delay = 30
- air_time = 120

Then:

```text
score = 100 - ((60 - 30) / 120) * 60
      = 100 - (30 / 120) * 60
      = 100 - 0.25 * 60
      = 100 - 15
      = 85
```

So this flight gets a score of **85**, which is pretty good!

Would you like me to rewrite this explanation directly into your page so it's part of your lab notes? Or maybe visualize how scores change for short vs long flights?
